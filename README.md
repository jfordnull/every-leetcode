# Every Leetcode

Hard to say how long I'll stick with this one, but I'm attempting each Leetcode sequentially.

**As an additonal constraint, I'll require my solution to beat 90% of other solutions in runtime or memory (preferably both) before I push.**

This project may develop slowly. I won't be looking at other solutions to any of these problems. But I will let the problems motivate my research so I can fill the gaps in my programming knowledge. (*No AI tools will be used either.*)
